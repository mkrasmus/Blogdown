abstract = "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the commonest arrhythmia after cardiac surgery, associated with longer hospital stay, increased morbidity and mortality. Develpment of POAF is certainly multifactorial, however the exact mechanism remains unknown. Left atrial (LA) enlargement is commonly assoicated with mitral valve disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of LA diameter on the incidence of POAF in patients undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. From September 2003 to December 2013, 1604 minimally invasive mitral valve replacement or repairs were performance. The incidence of POAF was 34% overall (n = 349). The logistic regression model parameters exhibited a beta-coefficient of 0.038 (p < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.021 - 0.055). For every millimeter increase in LA diameter, there is a corresponding increase in odds of POAF by a factor of 1.039. In patients undergoing minimally mitral valve surgery we found LA diameter to be an independent predictor of POAF with a monotonic increase relationship."
