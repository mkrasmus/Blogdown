abstract = "Aboriginal art is an effective, culture-specific therapy for Aboriginal people. Evidence suggests that this may have important implications for Aboriginal prisoners at risk of suicide/self-harm. This project aimed to evaluate the potential positive effects of Aboriginal art activiites on the suicide/self-harm risk behaviours of Aboriginal prisoners. An audit was undertaken of data related to suicide/self-harm risk behaviours of all male Aboriginal prisoners (N = 335) incarcerated in a single Australian prison between September 2009 and September 2010. The incidence of suicide/self-harm risk for Aboriginal prisoners who attended (N = 108) or did not attend (N= 227) an Aboriginal art program was analysed using binomial regression. Controlling for psychiatric illness and a history of suicide/self-harm behaviours, it was found that Aboriginal prisoners who attended the program had, on average, an 82.2% (P < 0.05; CI 95%: 0.3 to 96.8%) reduced risk of being assessed for suicidal or self-harm behaviours than those who did not attend. This study provides some evidence of the protective effect of Aboriginal art for reducing suicide/self-harm behaviours among Aboriginal prisoners."
