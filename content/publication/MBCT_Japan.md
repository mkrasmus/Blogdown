abstract = "Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) was developed as a therapeutic intervention for patients at risk of depression relapse. In recent years it has evolved as an effective therapy for a range of mental health concerns. The present study investigated the potential benefits of MBCT for English speaking foreigners living in Japan. Participants (n=18) completed the Five Factors Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21-item version (DASS-21) and the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) before and after the 8-week MBCT program. Participants reported a significant increase in mindfulness, reductions in depression, anxiety and stress levels as well as decreased negative affect. However, an increase in average positive affect scores was found to be non-significant. Acceptability of MBCT for foreign nationals living in Japan was demonstrated in participant feedback and this study lends some initial support for delivering MBCT as a preventative intervention for foreigners experiencing emotional distress in Japan."
