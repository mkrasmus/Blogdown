For my first post I'd like to encourage other R users to develop their own static websites using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package.

Feel free to use the code I've developed [on my github account](https://github.com/mkrasmus/Blogdown-MichaelRasmussen), but consider some better examples, including [Dr Hill's](https://alison.rbind.io/) and [Dr Cho Yang's](https://www.choyang.me/en/) websites using the same [academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) framework. <!--more-->

Register with [Github](https://github.com/) and install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) to version control and then deploy your website using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). Follow [Dr Hill's](https://alison.rbind.io/) recommendation for a free domain name with Github. I've decided to use a [godaddy](au.godaddy.com) account for a very small fee.

Showcase your publications or methods that would otherwise not see the light of day!
